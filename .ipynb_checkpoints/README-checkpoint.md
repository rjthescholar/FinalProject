Raja's datasets: Neighboorhood boundary dataset (included in project)
                 Traffic dataset (https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/6dfd4f8f-cbf5-4917-a5eb-fd07f4403167)
Fredrich D's Datasets:
Alec's Datasets: School Enrollment Dataset (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/3cb2b9c2-66e2-4ffa-b0a1-35fb2c6f7230/resource/eb1f8714-e0eb-4614-acfe-dfe0ebab942f/download/school-enrollment-by-detailed-level-of-school-for-the-population-3-years-and-over.csv)

We used the place where the best school is as our metric. We concluded that Central Oakland is the best school based on the traffic data(the one with the least percentage of speeders), diversity, and school enrollment.
